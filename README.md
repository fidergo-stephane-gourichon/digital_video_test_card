# About Test Card

Test Card can generate a test pattern image at any resolution and display it either fullscreen or in a window. It is also possible to save the currently displayed image to a file.

The image can be used to determine if your monitor (or e.g. a TV your computer is connected to) is displaying pixel perfect image or if it does something funky to it.
